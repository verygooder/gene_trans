AGPAT2	The AGPAT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. It plays a critical role in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes are the major component of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.The AGPAT2 enzyme is part of a chemical pathway in many cells that produces two important types of fats (lipids): glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.  Glycerophospholipids are the major component of cell membranes and are involved in chemical signaling within cells. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) are fat molecules that are stored in adipocytes for later conversion to energy.The AGPAT2 enzyme is responsible for a particular chemical reaction in the production of these two types of lipids.  Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to another molecule, phosphatidic acid (PA).  Additional reactions convert phosphatidic acid to glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.<> <>	AGPAT2基因提供了制造许多身体细胞和组织中发现的酶的说明。它在脂肪细胞的生长和发育中起着关键作用，脂肪细胞是储存脂肪供能的细胞。脂肪细胞是人体脂肪（脂肪）组织的主要成分.AGPAT2酶是许多细胞中产生两种重要类型脂肪（脂质）的化学途径的一部分：甘油磷脂和三酰甘油。甘油磷脂是细胞膜的主要成分，并参与细胞内的化学信号传导。三酰甘油（也称为甘油三酯）是储存在脂肪细胞中用于随后转化为能量的脂肪分子.AGPAT2酶在这两种类型的脂质的生产中负责特定的化学反应。具体而言，该酶有助于将称为溶血磷脂酸（LPA）的分子转化为另一种分子磷脂酸（PA）。另外的反应将磷脂酸转化成甘油磷脂和三酰甘油。<> <>	0
ACTN2	From NCBI Gene:Alpha actinins belong to the spectrin gene superfamily which represents a diverse group of cytoskeletal proteins, including the alpha and beta spectrins and dystrophins. Alpha actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it is involved in binding actin to the membrane. In contrast, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to the Z-disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the myofibrillar actin filaments. This gene encodes a muscle-specific, alpha actinin isoform that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

ACTC1	From NCBI Gene:Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types of cell motility. Polymerization of globular actin (G-actin) leads to a structural filament (F-actin) in the form of a two-stranded helix. Each actin can bind to four others. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the actin family which is comprised of three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus.

ACTA2	The ACTA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing (contraction) of muscles.Smooth muscle α-2 actin is found in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles line the internal organs, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines. Within smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle α-2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. Smooth muscles contract and relax as part of their normal function without being consciously controlled.Layers of smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Smooth muscle α-2 actin contributes to the ability of these muscles to contract, which allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them.<> <>	ACTA2基因提供制造称为平滑肌α（α）-2肌动蛋白的蛋白质的说明，肌动蛋白是肌动蛋白家族的一部分。肌动蛋白对于细胞运动和肌肉紧张（收缩）很重要。平滑肌细胞中发现平滑肌α-2肌动蛋白。平滑的肌肉排列内部器官，包括血管，胃和肠。在平滑肌细胞内，平滑肌α-2肌动蛋白形成称为肌节的结构的核心，这是肌肉收缩所必需的。平滑肌收缩和放松作为其正常功能的一部分而没有被有意识地控制。平滑肌细胞层位于动脉壁中，它是将血液从心脏输送到身体其他部位的血管。平滑肌α-2肌动蛋白有助于这些肌肉收缩的能力，这允许动脉保持其形状，而不是在血液通过它们时被拉伸出来。<> <>	0
ABCG8	The ABCG8 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-2, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin. The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-1, is produced from a gene called ABCG5. Sterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells.Sterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols. After plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces. This process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate levels of cholesterol, another fatty substance found in animal products, in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.<> <>	ABCG8基因提供了制造甾醇-2的说明，该甾醇-2构成称为甾醇的蛋白质的一半。另一半的甾醇蛋白，甾醇-1，由称为ABCG5的基因产生。 Sterolin参与消除植物甾醇，植物甾醇是人体细胞无法使用的植物性食物的脂肪组分。甾醇是一种转运蛋白，它是一种将物质穿过细胞膜的蛋白质。它主要存在于肠道和肝脏的细胞中，并运输植物甾醇。植物甾醇从食物中吸收到肠细胞中后，这些细胞中的甾醇转运蛋白将它们泵回肠道。肝细胞中的Sterolin转运体将植物甾醇泵入被称为胆汁的流体中，该胆汁释放到肠中。从肠道，植物甾醇与粪便一起消除。这个过程去除了大部分的饮食植物甾醇，并且只允许大约5％的这些物质进入血液。 Sterolin还以相似的方式帮助调节胆固醇水平，这是另一种在动物产品中发现的脂肪物质;通常约50％的饮食中的胆固醇被身体吸收。<> <>	0

ABCC8	The ABCC8 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) protein. The SUR1 protein is one part (subunit) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel that is found across cell membranes in the beta cells of the pancreas. Beta cells secrete insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. Insulin controls how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. The K-ATP channel controls the secretion of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which helps regulate insulin secretion and control blood sugar levels. The closing of the channels results in a process that triggers insulin secretion by beta cells.<> <>	ABCC8基因提供了制备磺酰脲受体1（SUR1）蛋白的说明。 SUR1蛋白是在胰腺β细胞中跨细胞膜发现的ATP敏感性钾（K-ATP）通道的一部分（亚基）。 β细胞分泌胰岛素，这是一种有助于控制血糖水平的激素。胰岛素控制了多少糖（以葡萄糖的形式）从血液中流入细胞，用作能量。 K-ATP通道控制胰岛素从β细胞分泌并进入血液。这些通道响应血流中葡萄糖的量而打开和关闭，这有助于调节胰岛素分泌和控制血糖水平。通道闭合导致β细胞引发胰岛素分泌的过程。“>”>	0
ABCC9	The ABCC9 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one part (subunit) of a channel that transports charged atoms of potassium (potassium ions) across cell membranes.  Each of these channels consists of eight subunits: four SUR2 proteins and four proteins produced from either the KCNJ8 or KCNJ11 gene. The SUR2 subunits regulate the activity of the channel, determining whether it is open or closed.Channels made with the SUR2 protein are known as ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels. The channels open and close in response to the amount of ATP, the cell's main energy source, inside the cell. The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells.Although K-ATP channels are present in cells and tissues throughout the body, the highest levels of SUR2-containing channels are found in skeletal and heart (cardiac) muscle. These channels indirectly help regulate the concentration of calcium ions in cells. This regulation is essential for normal heart function. The function of these channels in other tissues is unclear.<> <>	ABCC9基因提供了制备磺酰脲受体2（SUR2）蛋白的说明。这种蛋白质形成通道的一部分（亚基），其将钾的带电原子（钾离子）穿过细胞膜。每个通道由8个亚基组成：4个SUR2蛋白和4个由KCNJ8或KCNJ11基因产生的蛋白。 SUR2亚基调节通道的活性，确定它是否打开或关闭。用SUR2蛋白制成的通道称为ATP敏感性钾（K-ATP）通道。通道响应细胞内细胞主要能量源ATP的数量而打开和关闭。由此产生的钾离子运输是复杂的信号网络的一部分，这些信号将化学信息传入和传出细胞。尽管K-ATP通道存在于整个身体的细胞和组织中，但含有SUR2的通道的最高水平可见于骨骼和心脏（心脏）肌肉。这些通道间接帮助调节细胞内钙离子的浓度。该规定对于正常心脏功能是必不可少的。这些通道在其他组织中的功能尚不清楚。<> <>	0
ABCA1	"The ABCA1 gene belongs to a group of genes called the ATP-binding cassette family, which provides instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes. The ABCA1 protein is produced in many tissues, with high amounts found in the liver and in immune system cells called macrophages. This protein moves cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids across the cell membrane to the outside of the cell. These substances are then picked up by a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is produced from the APOA1 gene. ApoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipids combine to make high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. HDL is a molecule that carries cholesterol and phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.<> <>"	ABCA1基因属于称为ATP结合盒家族的一组基因，其提供了制造蛋白质的指导，所述蛋白质将分子穿过细胞膜转运。 ABCA1蛋白在许多组织中产生，在肝脏和被称为巨噬细胞的免疫系统细胞中发现高含量。这种蛋白质将胆固醇和某些称为磷脂的脂肪穿过细胞膜移动到细胞外。然后这些物质被称为载脂蛋白A-I（apoA-I）的蛋白质吸收，该蛋白质是由APOA1基因产生的。 ApoA-I，胆固醇和磷脂结合制造高密度脂蛋白（HDL），通常称为“好胆固醇”，因为高浓度的这种物质可以降低发生心脏和血管（心血管）疾病的几率。 HDL是一种通过血液中的胆固醇和磷脂从人体组织到肝脏的分子。一旦进入肝脏，胆固醇和磷脂就会重新分布到其他组织或从体内移除。从细胞中去除多余的胆固醇对于平衡胆固醇水平和维持心血管健康非常重要。“>”>	0

AKT2	From NCBI Gene:This gene is a putative oncogene encoding a protein belonging to a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases containing SH2-like (Src homology 2-like) domains. The gene was shown to be amplified and overexpressed in 2 of 8 ovarian carcinoma cell lines and 2 of 15 primary ovarian tumors. Overexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype of a subset of human ductal pancreatic cancers. The encoded protein is a general protein kinase capable of phophorylating several known proteins. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:AKT2 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis. This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates. Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported. AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface. Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity. Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven. AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating mTORC1 signaling and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1. AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization. In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319'. FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites. AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1. AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis. Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis. Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity. The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I. Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly. May be involved in the regulation of the placental development.One of the few specific substrates of AKT2 identified recently is PITX2. Phosphorylation of PITX2 impairs its association with the CCND1 mRNA-stabilizing complex thus shortening the half-life of CCND1. AKT2 seems also to be the principal isoform responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake. Phosphorylates C2CD5 on 'Ser-197' during insulin-stimulated adipocytes. AKT2 is also specifically involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, one of its substrates in this process being ANKRD2. Down-regulation by RNA interference reduces the expression of the phosphorylated form of BAD, resulting in the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Phosphorylates CLK2 on 'Thr-343'.<> <>	来自NCBI基因：该基因是编码属于含有SH2样（Src同源性2样）结构域的丝氨酸/苏氨酸激酶亚家族的蛋白质的推定癌基因。该基因显示在8个卵巢癌细胞系中的2个和15个原发性卵巢肿瘤中的2个中被扩增和过表达。过度表达有助于人胰腺癌的一部分的恶性表型。编码的蛋白质是能够磷酸化几种已知蛋白质的通用蛋白激酶。 [由RefSeq提供，2008年7月]来自UniProt：AKT2是称为AKT激酶的3种密切相关的丝氨酸/苏氨酸蛋白激酶（AKT1，AKT2和AKT3）之一，并且其调节许多过程，包括代谢，增殖，细胞存活，生长和血管生成。这是通过一系列下游底物的丝氨酸和/或苏氨酸磷酸化介导的。迄今为止已报道了超过100种底物候选物，但对于其中大多数来说，没有报道过亚型特异性。 AKT通过介导胰岛素诱导的SLC2A4 / GLUT4葡萄糖转运蛋白向细胞表面的转运来负责调节葡萄糖摄取。 'Ser-50'处PTPN1的磷酸化负调节其磷酸酶活性，防止胰岛素受体的去磷酸化和胰岛素信号传导的减弱。 TBC1D4的磷酸化触发该效应子与胰岛素刺激的葡萄糖转运所需的抑制性14-3-3蛋白的结合。 AKT还通过在'Ser-21'上磷酸化GSK3A和在'Ser-9'上磷酸化GSK3B来以糖原形式存储葡萄糖，从而抑制其激酶活性。通过AKT磷酸化GSK3同种型也被认为是驱动细胞增殖的一种机制。 AKT还通过磷酸化MAP3K5（细胞凋亡信号相关激酶）调节细胞存活。 'Ser-83'的磷酸化降低由氧化应激刺激的MAP3K5激酶活性，从而阻止细胞凋亡。 AKT通过在'Ser-939'和'Thr-1462'磷酸化TSC2介导胰岛素刺激的蛋白质合成，由此激活mTORC1信号传导并导致4E-BP1的磷酸化和RPS6KB1的活化。 AKT参与FOXO因子（Forkhead家族转录因子）成员的磷酸化，导致14-3-3蛋白的结合和细胞质定位。特别是，FOXO1在'Thr-24'，'Ser-256'和'Ser-319'处被磷酸化。 FOXO3和FOXO4在相同的位点被磷酸化。 AKT在调节NF-κB依赖性基因转录中发挥重要作用，并且正调节CREB1（环AMP（cAMP） - 应答元件结合蛋白）的活性。 CREB1的磷酸化诱导辅助蛋白的结合，所述辅助蛋白对于促进存活基因例如BCL2和MCL1的转录是必需的。 AKT在ATP柠檬酸裂解酶（ACLY）上磷酸化'Ser-454'，从而潜在地调节ACLY活性和脂肪酸合成。通过'Ser-273'的磷酸化激活环核苷酸磷酸二酯酶（PDE3B）的3B同种型，导致环AMP水平降低和脂解的抑制。 'Ser-318'上磷酸化PIKFYVE，导致PI（3）P-5活性增加。 Rho GTPase激活蛋白DLC1是另一种底物，其磷酸化涉及调控细胞增殖和细胞生长。 AKT作为AKT-mTOR信号通路的关键调节剂起作用，其控制成人神经发生过程中新生神经元整合过程的节奏，包括正确的神经元定位，树突发育和突触形成。信号在磷脂酰肌醇3-激酶（PI（3）K）下游介导各种生长因子如血小板衍生生长因子（PDGF），表皮生长因子（EGF），胰岛素和胰岛素样生长因子I（IGF -一世）。 AKT介导IGF-I的抗凋亡作用。对于SPATA13介导的细胞迁移和粘附组装和拆卸的调节至关重要。可能参与胎盘发育的调控。最近发现的AKT2的少数特异性底物之一是PITX2。磷酸化PITX2削弱其与CCND1 mRNA稳定复合物的关联，从而缩短CCND1的半衰期。 AKT2似乎也是负责调节葡萄糖摄取的主要同种型。在胰岛素刺激的脂肪细胞中在'Ser-197'上磷酸化C2CD5。 AKT2也特异性地参与骨骼肌分化，在这个过程中它的底物之一是ANKRD2。通过RNA干扰的下调减少了BAD的磷酸化形式的表达，导致半胱天冬酶依赖性细胞凋亡的诱导。在'Thr-343'上磷酸化CLK2。<> <>	0

APOB	The APOB gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein B protein, a short version called apolipoprotein B-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein B-100. Both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood.Apolipoprotein B-48 is produced in the intestine, where it is a building block of a type of lipoprotein called a chylomicron. As food is digested after a meal, chylomicrons are formed to carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream.  Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A.Apolipoprotein B-100, which is produced in the liver, is a component of several other types of lipoproteins.

ZFP57	The protein produced from the ZFP57 gene is a member of a family called zinc finger proteins, which are involved in many cellular functions. Zinc finger proteins each contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains. These regions include a specific pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) and one or more charged atoms of zinc (zinc ions).Zinc finger proteins attach (bind) primarily to DNA. In most cases, these proteins attach to regions near certain genes and turn the genes on and off as needed. Proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the activity of particular genes are known as transcription factors. Some zinc finger proteins can also bind to other molecules, including RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) and proteins.The ZFP57 protein is involved in the regulation of other genes by the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms (methylation). Methylation is important in many cellular functions.

WRN	The WRN gene provides instructions for producing the Werner protein, which plays a critical role in repairing damaged DNA. The Werner protein functions as a type of enzyme called a helicase. Helicase enzymes generally unwind and separate double-stranded DNA. The Werner protein also functions as an enzyme called an exonuclease. Exonucleases trim the broken ends of damaged DNA by removing DNA building blocks (nucleotides). Research suggests that the Werner protein first unwinds the DNA and then removes abnormal DNA structures that have been accidentally generated.Overall, the Werner protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of a person's DNA. This protein plays an important role in copying (replicating) DNA before cell division and transferring the information in genes to the cell machinery that makes proteins (transcription). Additionally, recent studies suggest that the Werner protein may be particularly important for maintaining DNA at the ends of chromosomes (telomeres).<> <>	WRN基因提供了产生Werner蛋白的说明，Werner蛋白在修复受损的DNA中起着关键作用。 Werner蛋白作为一种称为解旋酶的酶起作用。解旋酶通常展开并分离双链DNA。维尔纳蛋白质也起着称为核酸外切酶的酶的作用。核酸外切酶通过去除DNA结构单元（核苷酸）修剪受损DNA的断裂末端。研究表明，Werner蛋白首先解开DNA，然后去除意外产生的异常DNA结构。总之，Werner蛋白有助于维持人体DNA的结构和完整性。这种蛋白质在细胞分裂之前复制（复制）DNA并将基因中的信息转移到制造蛋白质（转录）的细胞机制中起着重要作用。此外，最近的研究表明Werner蛋白可能对维持染色体末端（端粒）DNA特别重要。<> <>	0
WNK4	The WNK4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in blood pressure regulation by helping control the amount of sodium and potassium in the body. The WNK4 protein acts as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.The WNK4 protein regulates channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells, which occurs primarily in the kidneys. Sodium channels help transport sodium into specialized kidney cells, which then transfer it into the blood. This transfer helps keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption. Potassium channels handle excess potassium that has been transferred from the blood into the kidney cells. The channels transport the potassium out of the cells in a process called secretion, so that it can be removed from the body in the urine. The WNK4 protein is able to promote sodium reabsorption and block potassium secretion.

WNK1	The WNK1 gene provides instructions for making multiple versions (isoforms) of the WNK1 protein. The different WNK1 isoforms are important in several functions in the body, including blood pressure regulation and pain sensation.One isoform produced from the WNK1 gene is the full-length version, called the L-WNK1 protein, which is found in cells throughout the body. A different isoform, called the kidney-specific WNK1 protein or KS-WNK1, is found only in kidney cells. The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins act as kinases, which are enzymes that change the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins regulate channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells. In the kidneys, sodium channels help transport sodium into specialized cells, which then transfer it into the blood. This transfer helps keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption. Potassium channels handle excess potassium that has been transferred from the blood into kidney cells. The channels transport potassium out of the cells in a process called secretion, so that it can be removed from the body in urine.The L-WNK1 protein increases sodium reabsorption and decreases potassium secretion, whereas the KS-WNK1 protein has the opposite effect. Sodium and potassium are important for regulating blood pressure, and a balance of L-WNK1 protein and KS-WNK1 protein in the kidneys helps maintain the correct levels of sodium and potassium for healthy blood pressure.Another isoform produced from the WNK1 gene, called the WNK1/HSN2 protein, is found in the cells of the nervous system, including nerve cells that transmit the sensations of pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons).

WFS1	The WFS1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called wolframin that is thought to regulate the amount of calcium in cells. A proper calcium balance is important for many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing (contraction) of muscles, and protein processing. The wolframin protein is found in many different tissues, such as the pancreas, brain, heart, bones, muscles, lungs, liver, and kidneys.Within cells, wolframin is located in the membrane of a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many activities, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3-dimensional shape to function properly. The endoplasmic reticulum also helps transport proteins and other molecules to specific sites within the cell or to the cell surface. Wolframin is thought to play a role in protein folding and aid in the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum function by regulating calcium levels.

VPS13B	Researchers are still working to determine the exact role of the VPS13B gene (also called the <em>COH1</em> gene) in the human body.

VHL	The VHL gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as part of a complex (a group of proteins that work together) called the VCB-CUL2 complex. This complex targets other proteins to be broken down (degraded) by the cell when they are no longer needed. Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells.One of the targets of the VCB-CUL2 complex is a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α). HIF-2α is one part (subunit) of a larger protein complex called HIF, which plays a critical role in the body's ability to adapt to changing oxygen levels. HIF controls several genes involved in cell division, the formation of new blood vessels, and the production of red blood cells. It is the major regulator of a hormone called erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production. HIF's function is particularly important when oxygen levels are lower than normal (hypoxia). However, when adequate oxygen is available, the VCB-CUL2 complex keeps HIF from building up inappropriately in cells.The VHL protein likely plays a role in other cellular functions, including the regulation of other genes and control of cell division. Based on this function, the VHL protein is classified as a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The VHL protein is also involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells and provides structural support to tissues.<> <>	VHL基因提供了制造一种蛋白质的说明，该蛋白质作为复合物（称为VCB-CUL2复合物的一组蛋白质）的一部分发挥功能。这种复合物的目标是其他蛋白质在细胞不再需要时被细胞分解（降解）。蛋白质降解是一种正常过程，可去除受损或不必要的蛋白质，并有助于维持细胞的正常功能。VCB-CUL2复合物的一个靶标是称为缺氧诱导因子2-α（HIF-2α）的蛋白质。 HIF-2α是称为HIF的较大蛋白质复合物的一部分（亚基），其在机体适应变化的氧水平的能力中起关键作用。 HIF控制参与细胞分裂，新血管形成和红细胞生成的几种基因。它是控制红细胞生成的称为促红细胞生成素的激素的主要调节剂。当氧气水平低于正常（缺氧）时，HIF的功能尤为重要。然而，当有足够的氧气供应时，VCB-CUL2复合体使HIF不能在细胞中不适当地形成.VHL蛋白可能在其他细胞功能中起作用，包括调节其他基因和控制细胞分裂。基于这一功能，VHL蛋白被归类为肿瘤抑制因子，这意味着它可以防止细胞生长和分裂过快或不受控制的方式。 VHL蛋白也参与细胞外基质的形成，细胞外基质是在细胞间空间形成的复杂晶格，并为组织提供结构支持。<> <>	0

UCP3	From NCBI Gene:Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) are members of the larger family of mitochondrial anion carrier proteins (MACP). UCPs separate oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis with energy dissipated as heat, also referred to as the mitochondrial proton leak. UCPs facilitate the transfer of anions from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane and the return transfer of protons from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They also reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in mammalian cells. The different UCPs have tissue-specific expression; this gene is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle. This gene's protein product is postulated to protect mitochondria against lipid-induced oxidative stress. Expression levels of this gene increase when fatty acid supplies to mitochondria exceed their oxidation capacity and the protein enables the export of fatty acids from mitochondria. UCPs contain the three solcar protein domains typically found in MACPs.

TTR	The TTR gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transthyretin. This protein transports vitamin A (retinol) and a hormone called thyroxine throughout the body. To transport thyroxine, four transthyretin proteins must be attached (bound) to each other to form a four-protein unit (tetramer). To transport retinol, transthyretin must form a tetramer and also bind to retinol binding protein. Transthyretin is produced primarily in the liver.

TTN	The TTN gene provides instructions for making a very large protein called titin. This protein plays an important role in muscles the body uses for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. Slightly different versions (called isoforms) of titin are made in different muscles.Within muscle cells, titin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. Titin has several functions within sarcomeres. One of the protein's main jobs is to provide structure, flexibility, and stability to these cell structures. Titin interacts with other muscle proteins, including actin and myosin, to keep the components of sarcomeres in place as muscles contract and relax. Titin also contains a spring-like region that allows muscles to stretch. Additionally, researchers have found that titin plays a role in chemical signaling and in assembling new sarcomeres.<> <>	TTN基因对应的是一个称为肌联蛋白（titin）的蛋白质。这种蛋白质非常大，在人体骨骼肌和心肌中起重要作用，在不同的肌肉组织中形成一些不同的异构体。在肌肉细胞中，肌联蛋白是肌节结构重要的组成部分，肌节是肌肉收缩的基本单位，它们由蛋白质构成，产生肌肉收缩所需的机械力。肌联蛋白在肌节中有几个功能，主要功能之一是为细胞提供结构，灵活性和稳定性。肌动蛋白与其他肌肉蛋白质，包括肌动蛋白和肌球蛋白相互作用，在肌肉收缩和放松时保持肌节结构。此外，研究人员发现，肌联蛋白在化学信号传导和组装新肌节中发挥作用	1

The primary features of this syndrome include retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities and learning disabilities. Experimentation in non-human eukaryotes suggests that this gene is expressed in ciliated cells and that it is involved in the formation of cilia.

TNNT2	The TNNT2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cardiac troponin T, which is found solely in the heart (cardiac) muscle. Cardiac troponin T is one of three proteins that make up the troponin protein complex in cardiac muscle cells. The troponin complex is part of a structure called the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are made up of thick and thin filaments.

The troponin complex, along with calcium, helps regulate contraction of cardiac muscle.For the heart to beat normally, cardiac muscle must contract and relax in a coordinated way. Cardiac troponin T helps coordinate contraction of the heart muscle. When calcium levels are low, the troponin complex binds to the thin filament in sarcomeres, which blocks the interaction between the thick and thin filaments that is needed for muscle contraction.

TBC1D4	From NCBI Gene:This gene is a member of the Tre-2/BUB2/CDC16 domain family. The protein encoded by this gene is a Rab-GTPase-activating protein, and contains two phopshotyrosine-binding domains (PTB1 and PTB2), a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD), a Rab-GTPase domain, and multiple AKT phosphomotifs. This protein is thought to play an important role in glucose homeostasis by regulating the insulin-dependent trafficking of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), important for removing glucose from the bloodstream into skeletal muscle and fat tissues. Reduced expression of this gene results in an increase in GLUT4 levels at the plasma membrane, suggesting that this protein is important in intracellular retention of GLUT4 under basal conditions. When exposed to insulin, this protein is phosphorylated, dissociates from GLUT4 vesicles, resulting in increased GLUT4 at the cell surface, and enhanced glucose transport. Phosphorylation of this protein by AKT is required for proper translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Individuals homozygous for a mutation in this gene are at higher risk for type 2 diabetes and have higher levels of circulating glucose and insulin levels after glucose ingestion.

SDHD	The SDHD gene provides instructions for making one of four subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. The SDH enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The SDHD protein helps anchor the SDH enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane.Within mitochondria, the SDH enzyme links two important pathways in energy conversion: the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation. As part of the citric acid cycle, the SDH enzyme converts a compound called succinate to another compound called fumarate. Negatively charged particles called electrons are released during this reaction. The electrons are transferred through the SDH subunits, including the SDHD protein, to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons create an electrical charge that provides energy for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.Succinate, the compound on which the SDH enzyme acts, is an oxygen sensor in the cell and can help turn on specific pathways that stimulate cells to grow in a low-oxygen environment (hypoxia). In particular, succinate stabilizes a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)  by preventing a reaction that would allow HIF to be broken down. HIF controls several important genes involved in cell division and the formation of new blood vessels in a hypoxic environment.The SDHD gene is a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.<> <>	SDHD基因提供了制造琥珀酸脱氢酶（SDH）酶的四个亚基之一的说明。 SDH酶在线粒体中起着关键作用，线粒体是细胞内的结构，将食物的能量转化为细胞可以使用的形式。 SDHD蛋白有助于将SDH酶锚定在线粒体膜上。在线粒体内，SDH酶将两种能量转换的重要途径联系在一起：柠檬酸循环（或三羧酸循环）和氧化磷酸化。作为柠檬酸循环的一部分，SDH酶将称为琥珀酸盐的化合物转化成另一种称为富马酸盐的化合物。在此反应过程中释放带负电的粒子称为电子。电子通过SDH亚基（包括SDHD蛋白）转移到氧化磷酸化途径。在氧化磷酸化中，电子产生电荷，为产生三磷酸腺苷（ATP）（细胞的主要能量来源）提供能量。琥珀酸盐，SDH酶作用的化合物是细胞中的氧传感器，可以帮助开启刺激细胞在低氧环境下生长的特定途径（缺氧）。具体而言，琥珀酸盐通过阻止允许HIF分解的反应来稳定称为缺氧诱导因子（HIF）的蛋白质。 HIF控制参与细胞分裂和在缺氧环境中形成新血管的几种重要基因。SDHD基因是肿瘤抑制剂，这意味着它阻止细胞生长并以不受控制的方式分裂。<> <>	0

Nociceptors are primarily involved in transmitting pain signals. The centers of nociceptors, known as the cell bodies, are located in a part of the spinal cord called the dorsal root ganglion. Fibers called axons extend from the cell bodies, reaching throughout the body to receive sensory information.

RYR2	The RYR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ryanodine receptor 2. This protein is part of a family of ryanodine receptors, which form channels that transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) within cells.Channels made with the ryanodine receptor 2 protein are found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells called myocytes. These channels are embedded in the outer membrane of a cell structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a storage center for calcium ions. The RYR2 channel controls the flow of calcium ions out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.For the heart to beat normally, the cardiac muscle must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. This cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation results from the precise control of calcium ions within myocytes. In response to certain signals, the RYR2 channel releases calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the surrounding cell fluid (the cytoplasm). The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration triggers the cardiac muscle to contract, which pumps blood out of the heart. Calcium ions are then transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the cardiac muscle relaxes.  In this way, the release and reuptake of calcium ions in myocytes produces a regular heart rhythm.<> <>	RYR2基因提供了制造称为ryanodine受体2的蛋白质的模板。该蛋白质是ryanodine受体家族的一员，形成可在细胞内转运钙离子的通道。在心肌细胞中发现由ryanodine受体2蛋白质构成的通道。这些通道嵌入细胞结构的外膜中，该细胞结构称为肌质网，充当钙离子的储存中心。 RYR2通道控制钙离子流出肌质网。对于心脏正常搏动，心肌必须以协调的方式收缩并放松。肌肉收缩和放松的循环由精确控制心肌细胞内的钙离子引起。响应某些信号，RYR2通道将钙离子从肌质网释放到周围的细胞质中。由此导致的钙离子浓度增加引发心肌收缩，从而将血液泵出心脏。钙离子然后被运回肌浆网，并且使心肌松弛。这样，心肌细胞中钙离子的释放和再摄取就会产生规律的心律。	1
SAR1B	The SAR1B gene provides instructions for making a protein found in enterocytes, which are cells that line the intestine and absorb nutrients.

Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin E and vitamin D.Chylomicrons are made up mostly of various types of fats (lipids); they also contain some proteins, mainly a protein called apolipoprotein B-48 that is produced only in the intestine.  Because chylomicrons are made up of lipids and proteins, they are known as lipoproteins.  Chylomicrons are released from enterocytes into the bloodstream so the body can use the lipids and fat-soluble vitamins they carry.  Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth and development.<> <>	SAR1B基因提供了制造在肠细胞中发现的蛋白质的说明，所述肠细胞是排列肠并吸收营养素的细胞。在肠内细胞中，SAR1B蛋白有助于运输称为乳糜微粒的分子。随着食物在饭后消化，乳糜微粒形成从肠道携带脂肪和胆固醇进入血液。乳糜微粒对于吸收某些脂溶性维生素如维生素E和维生素D也是必需的。乳糜微粒主要由各种类型的脂肪（脂质）组成;它们还含有一些蛋白质，主要是仅在肠中产生的称为载脂蛋白B-48的蛋白质。由于乳糜微粒由脂质和蛋白质组成，因此被称为脂蛋白。乳糜微粒从肠细胞释放到血液中，因此身体可以使用它们携带的脂质和脂溶性维生素。正常生长和发育需要足够的脂肪，胆固醇和维生素。“>”>	0

RIT1	The RIT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps cells survive during periods of cellular stress, such as unusually high energy demands. As part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, the RIT1 protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The RIT1 protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. To transmit signals during periods of cellular stress, the RIT1 protein is turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The RIT1 protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts the GTP to GDP. When the protein is bound to GDP, it does not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.The RIT1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The RIT1 gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes three other genes: KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. These proteins play important roles in cell division, cell differentiation, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).<> <>	RIT1基因提供了制造蛋白质的说明，该蛋白质可帮助细胞在细胞应激期间存活，例如异常高的能量需求。作为被称为RAS / MAPK途径的信号传导途径的一部分，RIT1蛋白将信号从细胞外传递到细胞的细胞核。这些信号指导细胞生长和分裂（增殖）或成熟，并承担专门功能（区分）。 RIT1蛋白是一种GTP酶，它意味着它将称为GTP的分子转化为另一种称为GDP的分子。为了在细胞应激期间传递信号，通过附着（结合）GTP分子来启动RIT1蛋白。 RIT1蛋白在将GTP转换为GDP时被关闭（失活）。当蛋白质与GDP结合时，它不会将信号传递给细胞核.RIT1基因属于一类称为致癌基因的基因。当突变时，癌基因有可能导致正常细胞癌变。 RIT1基因位于Ras癌基因家族中，其中还包括三种其他基因：KRAS，HRAS和NRAS。这些蛋白质在细胞分裂，细胞分化和细胞的自我破坏（凋亡）中发挥重要作用	0
RET	The RET gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in signaling within cells.  This protein appears to be essential for the normal development of several kinds of  nerve cells, including nerves in the intestine (enteric neurons) and the portion of the nervous system that controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate (the autonomic nervous system).  The RET protein is also necessary for normal kidney development and the production of sperm (spermatogenesis).The RET protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning of the protein allows it to interact with specific factors outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When molecules that stimulate growth and development (growth factors) attach to the RET protein, a complex cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell is triggered.  These reactions instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as dividing or maturing to take on specialized functions.<> <>	RET基因提供了产生参与细胞内信号传导的蛋白质的说明。这种蛋白质对于几种神经细胞的正常发育似乎是必不可少的，包括肠道神经元（肠神经元）和控制无意识身体功能的部分神经系统，如心率（自主神经系统）。 RET蛋白对于正常肾发育和精子生成（精子发生）也是必需的.ET蛋白跨越细胞膜，使得蛋白的一端保留在细胞内部，另一端从细胞外表面突出。蛋白质的这种定位使其能够与细胞外的特定因子相互作用，并接收有助于细胞对其环境作出反应的信号。当刺激生长和发育的分子（生长因子）附着到RET蛋白上时，会触发细胞内部的一系列复杂的化学反应。这些反应指示细胞发生某些变化，例如分化或成熟以发挥特殊功能。<> <>	0

PSEN1	The PSEN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin 1. This protein is one part (subunit) of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. Presenilin 1 carries out the major function of the complex, which is to cut apart (cleave) other proteins into smaller pieces called peptides. This process is called proteolysis, and presenilin 1 is described as the proteolytic subunit of γ-secretase.The γ-secretase complex is located in the membrane that surrounds cells, where it cleaves many different proteins that span the cell membrane (transmembrane proteins). This cleavage is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways that transmit signals from outside the cell into the nucleus. One of these pathways, known as Notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells.  Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function.The γ-secretase complex  may be best known for its role in processing amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is made in the brain and other tissues. γ-secretase cuts APP into smaller peptides, including soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and several versions of amyloid-beta (β) peptide.

PRKG1	From NCBI Gene:Mammals have three different isoforms of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (Ialpha, Ibeta, and II). These PRKG isoforms act as key mediators of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway and are important components of many signal transduction processes in diverse cell types. This PRKG1 gene on human chromosome 10 encodes the soluble Ialpha and Ibeta isoforms of PRKG by alternative transcript splicing. A separate gene on human chromosome 4, PRKG2, encodes the membrane-bound PRKG isoform II. The PRKG1 proteins play a central role in regulating cardiovascular and neuronal functions in addition to relaxing smooth muscle tone, preventing platelet aggregation, and modulating cell growth. This gene is most strongly expressed in all types of smooth muscle, platelets, cerebellar Purkinje cells, hippocampal neurons, and the lateral amygdala. Isoforms Ialpha and Ibeta have identical cGMP-binding and catalytic domains but differ in their leucine/isoleucine zipper and autoinhibitory sequences and therefore differ in their dimerization substrates and kinase enzyme activity. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]From UniProt:Serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as key mediator of the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling pathway. GMP binding activates PRKG1, which phosphorylates serines and threonines on many cellular proteins. Numerous protein targets for PRKG1 phosphorylation are implicated in modulating cellular calcium, but the contribution of each of these targets may vary substantially among cell types. Proteins that are phosphorylated by PRKG1 regulate platelet activation and adhesion, smooth muscle contraction, cardiac function, gene expression, feedback of the NO-signaling pathway, and other processes involved in several aspects of the CNS like axon guidance, hippocampal and cerebellar learning, circadian rhythm and nociception. Smooth muscle relaxation is mediated through lowering of intracellular free calcium, by desensitization of contractile proteins to calcium, and by decrease in the contractile state of smooth muscle or in platelet activation. Regulates intracellular calcium levels via several pathways: phosphorylates MRVI1/IRAG and inhibits IP3-induced Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, phosphorylation of KCNMA1 (BKCa) channels decreases intracellular Ca(2+) levels, which leads to increased opening of this channel. PRKG1 phosphorylates the canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) family which inactivates the associated inward calcium current. Another mode of action of NO/cGMP/PKGI signaling involves PKGI-mediated inactivation of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA). Phosphorylation of RHOA by PRKG1 blocks the action of this protein in myriad processes: regulation of RHOA translocation; decreasing contraction; controlling vesicle trafficking, reduction of myosin light chain phosphorylation resulting in vasorelaxation. Activation of PRKG1 by NO signaling alters also gene expression in a number of tissues. In smooth muscle cells, increased cGMP and PRKG1 activity influence expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins, levels of proteins in the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, down-regulation of the matrix proteins osteopontin and thrombospondin-1 to limit smooth muscle cell migration and phenotype. Regulates vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) functions in platelets and smooth muscle.<> <>	来自NCBI基因：哺乳动物具有三种不同的环状GMP依赖性蛋白激酶同种型（Ialpha，Ibeta和II）。这些PRKG同种型作为一氧化氮/ cGMP信号传导途径的关键介质，并且是不同细胞类型中许多信号转导过程的重要组分。人类10号染色体上的这个PRKG1基因通过替代性转录物剪接编码PRKG的可溶性Iα和Ibeta同种型。人染色体4上的单独基因PRKG2编码膜结合的PRKG亚型II。 PRKG1蛋白在调节心血管和神经元功能以及舒缓平滑肌张力，防止血小板聚集和调节细胞生长方面发挥着重要作用。该基因在所有类型的平滑肌，血小板，小脑浦肯野细胞，海马神经元和外侧杏仁核中表达最强烈。异构体Ialpha和Ibeta具有相同的cGMP-结合和催化结构域，但其亮氨酸/异亮氨酸拉链和自体抑制序列不同，因此其二聚化底物和激酶活性不同。 [由RefSeq提供，2011年9月]来自UniProt：作为一氧化氮（NO）/ cGMP信号通路的关键介质的丝氨酸/苏氨酸蛋白激酶。 GMP结合激活PRKG1，其使许多细胞蛋白上的丝氨酸和苏氨酸磷酸化。 PRKG1磷酸化的许多蛋白质靶标涉及调节细胞钙，但是这些靶标中的每一个对于细胞类型的贡献可能显着不同。被PRKG1磷酸化的蛋白质可调节血小板活化和粘附，平滑肌收缩，心脏功能，基因表达，NO信号通路的反馈，以及涉及CNS几个方面的其他过程，如轴突指导，海马和小脑学习，昼夜节律节奏和伤害感受。平滑肌松弛通过降低细胞内游离钙，通过使收缩蛋白对钙的脱敏作用，以及通过平滑肌的收缩状态或血小板活化的减少而介导。通过几种途径调节细胞内钙水平：磷酸化MRVI1 / IRAG并抑制IP3诱导的细胞内储存的Ca（2+）释放，KCNMA1（BKCa）通道的磷酸化降低细胞内Ca（2+）水平，这导致增加的开放渠道。 PRKG1使经典的瞬时受体电位通道（TRPC）家族磷酸化，从而使相关的内向钙电流失活。 NO / cGMP / PKGI信号传导的另一种作用模式涉及PKGI介导的Ras同源基因家族成员A（RhoA）的失活。 PRKG1对RHOA的磷酸化阻断了这种蛋白质在无数过程中的作用：调节RHOA易位;收缩减少;控制囊泡运输，减少肌球蛋白轻链磷酸化导致血管舒张。通过NO信号激活PRKG1也会改变许多组织中的基因表达。在平滑肌细胞中，增加的cGMP和PRKG1活性影响平滑肌特异性收缩蛋白的表达，NO / cGMP信号传导途径中的蛋白质水平，基质蛋白骨桥蛋白和血小板反应蛋白-1的下调以限制平滑肌细胞迁移和表型。在血小板和平滑肌中调节血管舒张刺激的磷蛋白（VASP）功能<> <>	0

POLD1	From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes the 125-kDa catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta. DNA polymerase delta possesses both polymerase and 3' to 5' exonuclease activity and plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene, and a pseudogene of this gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6.

Exhibits both DNA polymerase and 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activities (PubMed:16510448, PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433, PubMed:24035200, PubMed:24022480). Requires the presence of accessory proteins POLD2, POLD3 and POLD4 for full activity. Depending upon the absence (Pol-delta3) or the presence of POLD4 (Pol-delta4), displays differences in catalytic activity. Most notably, expresses higher proofreading activity in the context of Pol-delta3 compared with that of Pol-delta4 (PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433). Although both Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 process Okazaki fragments in vitro, Pol-delta3 may be better suited to fulfill this task, exhibiting near-absence of strand displacement activity compared to Pol-delta4 and stalling on encounter with the 5'-blocking oligonucleotides. Pol-delta3 idling process may avoid the formation of a gap, while maintaining a nick that can be readily ligated (PubMed:24035200).

POMC	The POMC gene provides instructions for making a protein called proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which is cut (cleaved) into smaller pieces called peptides that have different functions in the body. The peptides attach (bind) to one of several proteins in different regions of the body, and this binding triggers signaling pathways that control many important functions.One peptide produced from the POMC protein is called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH binds to melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), stimulating the release of a hormone called cortisol. This hormone helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress, and stops (suppresses) inflammation.Three similar peptides called alpha-, beta-, and gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormones (α-, β-, and γ-MSH) are also cut from the POMC protein. The primary role of α-MSH is in the pigment-producing cells of the skin and hair (melanocytes), where it binds to melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). This attachment stimulates the production and release of a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin and hair their color.The β-MSH peptide plays a role in weight regulation by binding to melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). Signaling through this receptor in the brain helps maintain the balance between energy from food taken into the body and energy spent by the body. The correct balance is important to control eating and weight. The α-MSH peptide can also bind to MC4R and help maintain the correct energy balance.Studies show that γ-MSH binds to melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R). Signaling stimulated by this interaction appears to be involved in regulating the amount of sodium in the body and controlling blood pressure, although the mechanism is unclear.Another peptide produced from POMC is β-endorphin.

CAVIN1	The CAVIN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cavin-1. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. It is most abundant in several types of cells: osteoblasts, which are cells that build bones; muscle cells; and adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes make up most of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.Studies suggest that cavin-1 plays an essential role in forming and stabilizing caveolae, which are small pouches in the membrane that surrounds cells. Caveolae have multiple functions, some of which are not well understood. They are known to be involved in the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), processing of molecules on their way into the cell, maintaining the cell structure, and regulating chemical signaling pathways. Caveolae are particularly numerous in adipocytes, where they appear to be essential for the normal transport, processing, and storage of fats.Within cells, cavin-1 is also found in the nucleus and in the fluid that surrounds the nucleus (the cytoplasm). In addition to its role in caveolae, studies suggest that this protein is involved in repairing damage to the outer cell membrane, cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement, stopping cell division in older cells (senescence), and regulating various chemical signaling pathways. The functions of cavin-1 likely differ depending on the type of cell and the part of the cell where the protein is found.<> <>	CAVIN1基因提供了制作蛋白质cavin-1的说明。这种蛋白质存在于整个身体的细胞和组织中。它在几种类型的细胞中是最丰富的：成骨细胞，它是构建骨骼的细胞;肌细胞;和脂肪细胞，它们是储存脂肪供能的细胞。脂肪细胞构成人体脂肪（脂肪）组织的大部分。研究表明，cavin-1在形成和稳定小窝囊泡中扮演着重要角色，小窝囊膜是细胞周围的膜囊。 Caveolae具有多种功能，其中一些功能尚未得到很好的理解。已知它们参与将分子从细胞膜转运至细胞内部（胞吞作用），分子在进入细胞的过程中处理，维持细胞结构以及调节化学信号传导途径。 Caveolae在脂肪细胞中特别多，它们似乎对脂肪的正常转运，加工和储存至关重要。在细胞中，cavin-1也在细胞核和围绕细胞核（细胞质）的液体中发现。除了它在小窝穴中的作用外，研究还表明这种蛋白质参与修复对外部细胞膜的损伤，细胞生长和分裂（增殖），细胞运动，停止老年细胞中的细胞分裂（衰老）以及调节各种化学信号途径。 cavin-1的功能可能根据细胞类型和发现蛋白质的细胞部分而不同。<> <>	0

In most cases, they attach to regions near certain genes and turn the genes on and off as needed. Proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the activity of particular genes are known as transcription factors. Some zinc finger proteins can also bind to other molecules, including RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) and proteins.The PLAGL1 protein helps regulate the cell's process for replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion (cell cycle), and is involved in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). It is also important in fetal growth. The PLAGL1 protein helps control another protein called the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (PACAP1).

It is involved in inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation, and differentiation in target tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with generalized glucocorticoid resistance. Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding either the same or different isoforms. Additional isoforms resulting from the use of alternate in-frame translation initiation sites have also been described, and shown to be functional, displaying diverse cytoplasm-to-nucleus trafficking patterns and distinct transcriptional activities (PMID:15866175).

NRAS	The NRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called N-Ras that is involved primarily in regulating cell division. Through a process known as signal transduction, the protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The N-Ras protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. The N-Ras protein acts like a switch, and it is turned on and off by the GTP and GDP molecules. To transmit signals, the N-Ras protein must be turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The N-Ras protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts the GTP to GDP. When the protein is bound to GDP, it does not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.The NRAS gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The NRAS gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes two other genes: HRAS and KRAS. The proteins produced from these three genes are GTPases. These proteins play important roles in cell division, cell differentiation, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).<> <>	NRAS基因提供了制造称为N-Ras的蛋白质的说明，该蛋白质主要参与调节细胞分裂。通过被称为信号转导的过程，蛋白质将信号从细胞外传递到细胞的细胞核。这些信号指导细胞生长和分裂（增殖）或成熟，并承担专门功能（区分）。 N-Ras蛋白是一种GTP酶，这意味着它将称为GTP的分子转化为另一种称为GDP的分子。 N-Ras蛋白就像一个开关，它被GTP和GDP分子打开和关闭。为了传递信号，必须通过附着（结合）GTP分子来打开N-Ras蛋白。当它将GTP转换成GDP时，N-Ras蛋白被关闭（失活）。当蛋白质与GDP结合时，它不会将信号传递给细胞核。NRAS基因属于一类称为致癌基因的基因。当突变时，癌基因有可能导致正常细胞癌变。 NRAS基因位于Ras癌基因家族中，其中还包括两个其他基因：HRAS和KRAS。从这三个基因产生的蛋白质是GTP酶。这些蛋白质在细胞分裂，细胞分化和细胞的自我破坏（凋亡）中发挥重要作用	0

NOTCH1	The NOTCH1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Notch1, a member of the Notch family of receptors. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Attachment of a ligand to the Notch1 receptor sends signals that are important for normal development of many tissues throughout the body, both before birth and after. Notch1 signaling helps determine the specialization of cells into certain cell types that perform particular functions in the body (cell fate determination). It also plays a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and self-destruction (apoptosis).The protein produced from the NOTCH1 gene has such diverse functions that the gene is considered both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor. Oncogenes typically promote cell proliferation or survival, and when mutated, they have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. In contrast, tumor suppressors keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way, preventing the development of cancer; mutations that impair tumor suppressors can lead to cancer development.<> <>	NOTCH1基因提供了制造称为Notch1的蛋白质的说明，该蛋白质是Notch受体家族的成员。受体蛋白质具有特定的位点，称为配体的某些其他蛋白质适合锁入锁中。配体与Notch1受体的结合在发生之前和之后都会发出对全身许多组织的正常发育都很重要的信号。 Notch1信号有助于确定细胞在体内执行特定功能（细胞命运决定）的某些细胞类型的特化。它还在细胞生长和分裂（增殖），成熟（分化）和自我毁灭（细胞凋亡）从NOTCH1基因产生.The蛋白的角色具有该基因被认为是既致癌基因和肿瘤抑制这样的多种功能。癌基因通常促进细胞增殖或存活，当发生突变时，它们有可能导致正常细胞癌变。相反，肿瘤抑制剂保持细胞的生长和分裂过快或以不受控制的方式，阻止癌症的发展;破坏肿瘤抑制因子的突变可能导致癌症发展。<> <>	0

MYH7	The MYH7 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the beta (β)-myosin heavy chain. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and in type I skeletal muscle fibers. (Skeletal muscle are the muscles used for movement.) Type I fibers, which are also known as slow-twitch fibers, are one of two types of fibers that make up skeletal muscles. Type I fibers are the primary component of skeletal muscles that are resistant to fatigue. For example, muscles involved in posture, such as the neck muscles that hold the head steady, are made predominantly of type I fibers.In cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, the β-myosin heavy chain forms part of a larger protein called type II myosin. Each type II myosin protein consists of two heavy chains (produced from the MYH7 gene) and two pairs of regulatory light chains (produced from several other genes). The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region, called the motor domain, interacts with a protein called actin, which is important for cell movement and shape. The long tail region interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosin proteins.Type II myosin generates the mechanical force that is needed for muscles to contract. It is integral to muscle cell structures called sarcomeres, which are the basic units of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of thick filaments made up of type II myosin and thin filaments made up of actin. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. In the heart, regular contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood to the rest of the body. The coordinated contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles allow the body to move.<> <>	MYH7基因提供了制造称为β-肌球蛋白重链的蛋白质的模板。这种蛋白质在心肌和I型骨骼肌纤维中发现。I型纤维，也称为慢肌纤维，是组成骨骼肌的两种纤维之一。 I型纤维是抵抗疲劳的骨骼肌肉的主要成分。涉及姿势的肌肉，例如保持头部稳定的颈部肌肉，主要由I型纤维制成。在心脏和骨骼肌细胞中，β-肌球蛋白重链形成称为II型肌球蛋白的较大蛋白质的一部分。每种II型肌球蛋白由两条重链（由MYH7基因产生）和两对调控轻链（由几个其他基因产生）组成。重链各有两部分：头部区域和尾部区域。头部区域称为运动区域，与称为肌动蛋白的蛋白质相互作用，这对细胞运动和形状非常重要。长的尾部区域与其他蛋白质相互作用，包括其他肌球蛋白的尾部区域。II型肌球蛋白产生肌肉收缩所需的机械力。它是肌肉细胞结构（肌节）不可分割的一部分，肌节是肌肉收缩的基本单位。 肌节由II型肌球蛋白组成的粗丝和由肌动蛋白组成的细丝组成。重叠的粗细丝彼此附着并释放，这允许细丝相对于彼此移动，从而肌肉可以收缩。在心脏中，心肌的定期收缩将血液泵送到身体的其他部位。骨骼肌的协调收缩和松弛使身体能够移动。	1

LPL	The LPL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme is found primarily on the surface of cells that line tiny blood vessels (capillaries) within muscles and in fatty (adipose) tissue. Lipoprotein lipase plays a critical role in breaking down fat in the form of triglycerides, which are carried from various organs to the blood by molecules called lipoproteins.Lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides carried by two different types of lipoproteins, which bring fat to the bloodstream from different organs. Fat from the intestine, which is taken in from the diet, is transported to the bloodstream by lipoproteins called chylomicrons. Another type of lipoprotein called very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) carries triglycerides from the liver to the bloodstream. When lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides, the fat molecules are used by the body as energy or stored in fatty tissue for later use.<> <>	LPL基因提供了制造称为脂蛋白脂肪酶的酶的说明。这种酶主要存在于肌肉内和脂肪（脂肪）组织中微血管（毛细血管）的细胞表面。脂蛋白脂肪酶在分解甘油三酯形式中发挥重要作用，甘油三酯通过称为脂蛋白的分子从各种器官携带到血液中。脂蛋白脂肪酶分解由两种不同类型的脂蛋白携带的甘油三酯，其将脂肪带入血液中不同的器官。从饮食中摄取的肠道脂肪被称为乳糜微粒的脂蛋白转运到血液中。另一种称为极低密度脂蛋白（VLDL）的脂蛋白将甘油三酸酯从肝脏输送到血液中。当脂蛋白脂肪酶分解甘油三酯时，脂肪分子被身体用作能量或储存在脂肪组织中供以后使用。<> <>	0

LMNA	The LMNA gene provides instructions for making several slightly different proteins called lamins. The two major proteins produced from this gene, lamin A and lamin C, are made in most of the body's cells. These proteins are made up of a nearly identical sequence of protein building blocks (amino acids). The small difference in the sequence makes lamin A longer than lamin C.Lamins A and C are structural proteins called intermediate filament proteins. Intermediate filaments provide stability and strength to cells. Lamins A and C are scaffolding (supporting) components of the nuclear envelope, which is a structure that surrounds the nucleus in cells. Specifically, these proteins are located in the nuclear lamina, a mesh-like layer of intermediate filaments and other proteins that is attached to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. Lamins A and C are also found inside the nucleus, and researchers believe the proteins may play a role in regulating the activity (expression) of certain genes.The lamin A protein must be processed within the cell before becoming part of the lamina.

The function of the LDLRAP1 protein is particularly important in the liver, which is the organ responsible for clearing most excess cholesterol from the body.The LDLRAP1 protein interacts with a protein called a low-density lipoprotein receptor.

LCAT	The LCAT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). This enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). The body needs this substance to build cell membranes, make certain hormones, and produce compounds that aid in fat digestion. Too much cholesterol, however, increases a person's risk of developing heart disease, and can also lead to buildup of cholesterol in other tissues.The LCAT enzyme helps transport cholesterol out of the blood and tissues by a process called cholesterol esterification. This process results in a form of cholesterol that is more efficiently carried by molecules called lipoproteins, which transport the cholesterol to the liver. Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called  alpha- and beta-LCAT activity. Alpha-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Beta-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).<> <>	LCAT基因提供了制造称为卵磷脂 - 胆固醇酰基转移酶（LCAT）的酶的说明。这种酶在从血液和组织中去除胆固醇中起作用。胆固醇是一种蜡状脂肪样物质，在体内产生并从动物（特别是蛋黄，肉类，家禽，鱼类和乳制品）中获得。身体需要这种物质来建立细胞膜，制造某些激素，并产生有助于脂肪消化的化合物。然而，过多的胆固醇会增加患者发生心脏病的风险，并且还会导致胆固醇在其他组织中积聚.LCAT酶通过称为胆固醇酯化的过程帮助将胆固醇转运出血液和组织。这个过程产生一种胆固醇形式，这种胆固醇被称为脂蛋白的分子更有效地携带，这种分子将胆固醇转运到肝脏。一旦进入肝脏，胆固醇就会重新分布到其他组织或从体内去除。该酶有两个主要功能，称为α-和β-LCAT活性。 Alpha-LCAT活性有助于将胆固醇与称为高密度脂蛋白（HDL）的脂蛋白结合。 Beta-LCAT活性有助于将胆固醇与称为极低密度脂蛋白（VLDL）和低密度脂蛋白（LDL）的其他脂蛋白结合。<> <>	0
LAMA4	From NCBI Gene:Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the alpha chain isoform laminin, alpha 4. The domain structure of alpha 4 is similar to that of alpha 3, both of which resemble truncated versions of alpha 1 and alpha 2, in that approximately 1,200 residues at the N-terminus (domains IV, V and VI) have been lost. Laminin, alpha 4 contains the C-terminal G domain which distinguishes all alpha chains from the beta and gamma chains. The RNA analysis from adult and fetal tissues revealed developmental regulation of expression, however, the exact function of laminin, alpha 4 is not known. Tissue-specific utilization of alternative polyA-signal has been described in literature. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]From UniProt:Binding to cells via a high affinity receptor, laminin is thought to mediate the attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components.<> <>	层粘连蛋白（一种细胞外基质糖蛋白家族）是基底膜的主要非胶原成分。它们涉及多种生物过程，包括细胞粘附，分化，迁移，信号传导，神经突生长和转移。层粘连蛋白由3个不相同的链组成：层粘连蛋白α，β和γ，它们形成由3条短臂组成的十字形结构，每条臂由不同的链形成，在所有3个链中。每个层粘连蛋白链是由不同基因编码的多结构域蛋白。不同链和三聚体分子的生物学功能大部分是未知的，但一些链条已被证明在组织分布方面有所不同，大概反映了体内不同的功能。层粘连蛋白，α4含有C-末端G结构域，区分β和γ链的所有α链。来自成人和胎儿组织的RNA分析揭示了表达的发育调控，然而，层粘连蛋白α4的确切功能未知。	1
KRAS	The KRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called K-Ras that is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway. The protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The K-Ras protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. In this way the K-Ras protein acts like a switch that is turned on and off by the GTP and GDP molecules. To transmit signals, it must be turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The K-Ras protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts the GTP to GDP.

Can promote endothelial cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis in adulthood. Its function in promoting cell proliferation seems to be cell-type specific. Promotes PGF-mediated proliferation of endothelial cells, proliferation of some types of cancer cells, but does not promote proliferation of normal fibroblasts (in vitro).

CLCNKA	The CLCNKA gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCNKA gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-Ka. These channels are found predominantly in the kidneys. ClC-Ka is one of several proteins that work together to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. The transport of chloride ions by ClC-Ka channels is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.ClC-Ka channels are also located in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.<> <>	CLCNKA基因属于CLC家族基因，提供制造氯化物通道的说明。这些传输负电荷氯原子（氯离子）的通道在细胞产生和传输电信号的能力中起着关键作用。一些CLC通道调节氯离子通过细胞膜的流动，而另一些CLC通道则在细胞内转运氯离子.CLCNKA基因提供了制造称为ClC-Ka的氯通道的说明。这些通道主要在肾脏中找到。 ClC-Ka是几种蛋白质之一，它们共同作用以调节离子进出肾​​细胞的运动。通过ClC-Ka通道转运氯离子是肾脏从尿液中重吸收盐（氯化钠或氯化钠）回到血液中的机制的一部分。盐的滞留影响人体的液体水平并有助于维持血压.CCl-Ka通道也位于内耳，在正常听力中它们起着作用。<> <>	0
CEP290	The CEP290 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is present in many types of cells. Although this protein's function is not well understood, studies suggest that it plays an important role in cell structures called centrosomes and cilia. Centrosomes are involved in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape.

Type III collagen is found in the skin, lungs, intestinal walls, and the walls of blood vessels.The components of type III collagen, called pro-α1(III) chains, are produced from the COL3A1 gene. Each molecule of type III procollagen is made up of three copies of this chain.The triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature type III collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another and with other types of collagen in the spaces between cells.

CDKN1B	The CDKN1B gene provides instructions for making a protein called p27. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. Within cells, p27 is located primarily in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and division. It helps regulate the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion. Specifically, p27 normally blocks cells from entering the phase of the cell cycle when DNA is copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. By blocking cell cycle progression, p27 prevents cells from dividing too quickly or at the wrong time. Based on this function, p27 is described as a tumor suppressor protein. Studies suggest that p27 is also involved in controlling cell differentiation, which is the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions.Because p27 plays such a key role in controlling cell division, its activity is tightly regulated. Regulation can occur through modification of the p27 protein's structure, its interaction with other proteins, or its localization within the cell. For example, when p27 is held (sequestered) in the fluid that surrounds the nucleus (the cytoplasm) instead of being transported into the nucleus, the protein is unavailable to block cell cycle progression. Researchers believe that p27 may have other functions in the cytoplasm, but these functions have not been well described.<> <>	CDKN1B基因提供了制作蛋白质p27的说明。这种蛋白质存在于整个身体的细胞和组织中。在细胞内，p27主要位于细胞核内，它在控制细胞生长和分裂方面发挥着关键作用。它有助于调节细胞周期，这是细胞以有组织，循序渐进的方式复制自身的方式。具体而言，当DNA被复制（复制）以准备细胞分裂时，p27通常阻止细胞进入细胞周期的阶段。通过阻断细胞周期进程，p27阻止细胞分裂得太快或在错误的时间。基于此功能，p27被描述为肿瘤抑制蛋白。研究表明p27还参与调控细胞分化，这是细胞成熟发挥特定功能的过程。由于p27在控制细胞分裂中起着关键作用，其活性受到严格调控。调节可以通过修饰p27蛋白质的结构，与其他蛋白质的相互作用或其在细胞内的定位发生。例如，当p27在围绕细胞核（细胞质）的液体中被保持（隔离）而不是被运输到细胞核中时，蛋白质不能阻断细胞周期进展。研究人员认为p27可能在细胞质中具有其他功能，但这些功能尚未得到很好的描述。<> <>	0

A pseudogene of this gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3. Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2010]From UniProt:Binds to lipid droplets and regulates their enlargement, thereby restricting lipolysis and favoring storage. At focal contact sites between lipid droplets, promotes directional net neutral lipid transfer from the smaller to larger lipid droplets. The transfer direction may be driven by the internal pressure difference between the contacting lipid droplet pair. Its role in neutral lipid transfer and lipid droplet enlargement is activated by the interaction with PLIN1. May act as a CEBPB coactivator in the white adipose tissue to control the expression of a subset of CEBPB downstream target genes, including SOCS1, SOCS3, TGFB1, TGFBR1, ID2 and XDH. When overexpressed in preadipocytes, induces apoptosis or increases cell susceptibility to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or TGFB treatment.

CAV1	The CAV1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called caveolin-1. This protein appears to have diverse functions in cells and tissues throughout the body.Caveolin-1 is the major component of caveolae, which are small pouches in the membrane that surrounds cells. Caveolae have multiple functions, some of which are not well understood. They are known to be involved in the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), processing of molecules on their way into the cell, maintaining the cell structure, and regulating chemical signaling pathways. Studies suggest that caveolae are particularly numerous in adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes make up most of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue. In these cells, caveolae appear to be essential for the normal transport, processing, and storage of fats.Caveolin-1 is also found in many other parts of cells, where it regulates various chemical signaling pathways. Through these pathways, caveolin-1 is involved in regulating cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), cell survival and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and cell movement.

CASR	The CASR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcium molecules attach (bind) to CaSR, which allows this protein to monitor and regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. The receptor is turned on (activated) when a certain concentration of calcium is reached, and the activated receptor sends signals to block processes that increase the amount of calcium in the blood.The CaSR protein is found in abundance in cells of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands produce and release a hormone called parathyroid hormone that works to increase the levels of calcium in the blood. When large amounts of calcium bind to CaSR in the parathyroid glands, the production of parathyroid hormone is blocked, which prevents the release of more calcium into the blood. CaSR signaling also blocks the growth and division (proliferation) of cells that make up the parathyroid glands.The CaSR protein is also found in kidney cells. Kidneys filter fluid and waste products in the body and can reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Increased calcium binding to CaSR in kidney cells blocks the reabsorption of calcium from the filtered fluids.<> <>	CASR基因提供了制造称为钙敏感受体（CaSR）的蛋白质的说明。钙分子附着（结合）CaSR，这允许这种蛋白质监测和调节血液中钙的量。当达到一定浓度的钙时，受体被打开（激活），并且活化的受体发送信号以阻断增加血液中钙量的过程.CaSR蛋白在甲状旁腺细胞中存在丰度。甲状旁腺产生并释放称为甲状旁腺激素的激素，其用于增加血液中钙的水平。当大量钙与甲状旁腺中的CaSR结合时，甲状旁腺激素的产生被阻断，这阻止了更多钙释放到血液中。 CaSR信号还阻断组成甲状旁腺的细胞的生长和分裂（增殖）。CaSR蛋白也在肾细胞中发现。肾脏在体内过滤流体和废物，并且可以重新吸收所需的营养物质并将它们释放回血液中。在肾细胞中钙结合CaSR的增加阻断了钙从过滤流体中的重吸收	0
CASQ2	The CASQ2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called calsequestrin 2. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells called myocytes, where it is involved in the storage and transport of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions).Within myocytes, calsequestrin 2 is located in a cell structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a storage center for calcium ions. Most of these ions are stored by attaching (binding) to calsequestrin 2. This protein also helps regulate a protein called the RYR2 channel, which controls the flow of calcium ions out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.For the heart to beat normally, the cardiac muscle must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. This cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation results from the precise control of calcium ions within myocytes. In response to certain signals, calcium ions stored by calsequestrin 2 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum are released into the surrounding cell fluid (the cytoplasm). The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration triggers the cardiac muscle to contract, which pumps blood out of the heart. Calcium ions are then transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the cardiac muscle relaxes. In this way, the release and reuptake of calcium ions in myocytes produces a regular heart rhythm.<> <>	CASQ2基因提供了制造蛋白质Calsequestrin 2的说明。这种蛋白质在称为肌细胞的心脏（心脏）肌肉细胞中被发现，它参与储存和运输带正电的钙原子（钙离子）。在肌细胞中，calsequestrin 2位于称为肌质网的细胞结构中，其作为钙离子的储存中心。大多数这些离子通过附着（结合）到calsequestrin 2来储存。该蛋白质还有助于调节称为RYR2通道的蛋白质，其控制钙离子流出肌质网。对于心脏正常跳动，心肌必须以一种协调的方式紧张（合同）并放松。肌肉收缩和松弛的这个循环由精确控制心肌细胞内的钙离子引起。响应某些信号，calsequestrin 2储存在肌质网中的钙离子释放到周围的细胞液（细胞质）中。由此导致的钙离子浓度增加引发心肌收缩，从而将血液泵出心脏。钙离子然后被运回肌浆网，并且心肌松弛。这样，心肌细胞中钙离子的释放和再摄取就会产生规律的心律。“>”>	0

The large catalytic subunit has four domains: domain I, the N-terminal regulatory domain that is processed upon calpain activation; domain II, the protease domain; domain III, a linker domain of unknown function; and domain IV, the calmodulin-like calcium-binding domain. This gene encodes a large subunit. It is an atypical calpain in that it lacks the calmodulin-like calcium-binding domain and instead has a divergent C-terminal domain. It is similar in organization to calpains 5 and 6. This gene is associated with type 2 or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and is located within the NIDDM1 region. Multiple alternative transcript variants have been described for this gene.

CALM2	From NCBI Gene:This gene is a member of the calmodulin gene family. There are three distinct calmodulin genes dispersed throughout the genome that encode the identical protein, but differ at the nucleotide level. Calmodulin is a calcium binding protein that plays a role in signaling pathways, cell cycle progression and proliferation. Several infants with severe forms of long-QT syndrome (LQTS) who displayed life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias together with delayed neurodevelopment and epilepsy were found to have mutations in either this gene or another member of the calmodulin gene family (PMID:23388215).

CACNA1C	The CACNA1C gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels.  These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.  Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.The calcium channel produced from the CACNA1C gene is known as CaV1.2.  These channels are found in many types of cells, although they appear to be particularly important for the normal function of heart and brain cells.  In the heart, CaV1.2 channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of calcium ions into cardiac muscle cells.  By changing the electrical properties of these cells, calcium channels signal the cardiac muscle to contract and help maintain the heart's normal rhythm.  The channels' role in the brain and in other tissues is less clear.Researchers have discovered that many different versions of the CaV1.2 channel can be produced from the CACNA1C gene by a mechanism called alternative splicing.  This mechanism produces different versions of the channel by cutting and rearranging the genetic instructions in different ways.  Some versions of the CaV1.2 channel are more common than others in certain parts of the body.  For example, in the heart and brain, about 80 percent of CaV1.2 channels are made with a particular segment known as exon 8.  The other 20 percent of CaV1.2 channels contain a slightly different version of this segment, known as exon 8A.  This difference becomes important when researchers are studying the effects of CACNA1C mutations in various tissues.<> <>	CACNA1C基因属于提供制造钙通道的说明的基因家族。这些将带正电荷的钙原子（钙离子）输送到细胞中的通道在细胞产生和传输电信号的能力中起着关键作用。钙离子参与许多不同的细胞功能，包括细胞间通讯，肌肉纤维紧张（肌肉收缩）以及某些基因的调节.CACNA1C基因产生的钙通道被称为CaV1.2。这些通道存在于许多类型的细胞中，尽管它们对于心脏和脑细胞的正常功能似乎特别重要。在心脏中，CaV1.2通道在特定时间打开和关闭，以控制钙离子流入心肌细胞。通过改变这些细胞的电特性，钙通道发出信号使心肌收缩并帮助维持心脏的正常节律。这些通道在大脑和其他组织中的作用不太清楚。研究人员已经发现，通过称为选择性剪接的机制，可以从CACNA1C基因产生许多不同版本的CaV1.2通道。该机制通过以不同方式切割和重新排列基因指令来产生不同版本的通道。 CaV1.2通道的某些版本比身体某些部位的其他版本更为常见。例如，在心脏和大脑中，约80％的CaV1.2通道是由称为外显子8的特定片段制成的。另外20％的CaV1.2通道包含该片段的略微不同的形式，称为外显子8A 。当研究人员研究CACNA1C突变在各种组织中的作用时，这种差异就变得很重要	0
CACNA1D	The CACNA1D gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. The CACNA1D gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV1.3. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV1.3 channels are found in many types of cells, although they play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of calcium through CaV1.3 channels appears to help regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. CaV1.3 channels are also found in the brain, heart, and inner ear, although their roles in these tissues are not well understood.<> <>	CACNA1D所属的基因家族提供制造钙通道的模板，这些通道使钙离子能穿过细胞膜。 CACNA1D对应的蛋白称为α-1亚基，这个亚基形成钙离子可以流过的通道。 该通道存在于许多类型的细胞中，同时在肾上腺中扮演着特别重要的角色。在肾上腺中，通过该通道的钙流动似乎有助于调节激素醛固酮的产生，这有助于通过保持体内合适的盐和液体水平来控制血压。 该通道也存在于大脑，心脏和内耳中，尽管它们在这些组织中的作用尚未得到很好的理解。	1
BSND	The BSND gene provides instructions for making a protein called barttin. This protein is found primarily in the kidneys, where it attaches (binds) to two specific chloride channels: ClC-Ka (produced from the CLCNKA gene) and ClC-Kb (produced from the CLCNKB gene). The ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels transport charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) out of kidney cells.Barttin is essential for the normal placement of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels in the cell membrane. It also regulates the channels' stability and function. The transport of chloride ions is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.Barttin, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb are also found in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.<> <>	BSND基因提供了制造蛋白质的说明。这种蛋白主要存在于肾脏中，在肾脏附着（结合）两种特定的氯离子通道：ClC-Ka（由CLCNKA基因产生）和ClC-Kb（由CLCNKB基因产生）。 ClC-Ka和ClC-Kb通道将氯的带电原子（氯离子）从肾细胞中转移出来。巴丁酮对于正常放置细胞膜中的ClC-Ka和ClC-Kb通道至关重要。它还调节渠道的稳定性和功能。氯离子的转运是肾脏从尿液中重吸收盐（氯化钠或氯化钠）返回血液的机制的一部分。盐的滞留会影响人体的体液水平并有助于维持血压。巴丁，ClC-Ka和ClC-Kb也可在内耳中发现，它们在正常听力中发挥作用。<> <>	0

[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]From UniProt:Non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in B-lymphocyte development, differentiation and signaling. B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling requires a tight regulation of several protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and associated coreceptors. Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation. Signaling through BLK plays an important role in transmitting signals through surface immunoglobulins and supports the pro-B to pre-B transition, as well as the signaling for growth arrest and apoptosis downstream of B-cell receptor.

AVP	The AVP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH starts out as a larger molecule called a preprohormone, which is cut (cleaved) and modified to produce the active hormone and several related proteins. The preprohormone is made in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then transported to the nearby pituitary gland, where active ADH is stored until it is needed.The major function of ADH is to help control the body's water balance by determining how much water is excreted in urine. Normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the pituitary gland releases more ADH into the bloodstream. High levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and to make less urine. When fluid intake is adequate, the pituitary gland releases less ADH. Lower levels of this hormone cause the kidneys to reabsorb less water and to make more urine.<> <>	AVP基因提供了制造称为加压素或抗利尿激素（ADH）的激素的说明。 ADH起初是一种称为前激素的较大分子，它被切割（切割）并被修饰以产生活性激素和几种相关蛋白。前激素是在称为下丘脑的大脑区域制造的。然后它被运送到附近的脑下垂体，在那里储存活性ADH直到需要。ADH的主要功能是通过确定尿液中有多少水分排出体外，帮助控制身体的水分平衡。正常情况下，当一个人的液体摄入量低或流失很多时（例如，通过出汗），脑下垂体会释放更多的ADH进入血液。这种激素的高水平指导肾脏重新吸收更多的水分并减少尿量。当液体摄入量充足时，垂体腺释放较少的ADH。这种激素水平降低会导致肾脏重新吸收更少的水分并制造更多的尿液。“>”>	0

The placement of these channels is controlled by a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone triggers chemical reactions that ultimately insert aquaporin 2 water channels into the membrane of collecting duct cells. These channels allow water to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which makes the urine more concentrated. When fluid intake is adequate, less ADH is produced. Without signals from ADH, aquaporin 2 water channels are removed from the membrane of collecting duct cells. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.<> <>	AQP2基因提供了制造称为水通道蛋白2的蛋白质的说明。该蛋白质形成通过细胞膜携带水分子的通道。它被发现在肾脏中，称为收集管道，它是一系列将肾脏中的水重新吸收到血液中的小管道。水通道蛋白2水通道在维持人体水分平衡方面发挥着重要作用。这些通道的位置由一种称为血管加压素或抗利尿激素（ADH）的激素控制。当一个人的液体摄入量低或大量液体流失时（例如，通过出汗），身体会产生更多的ADH。这种激素触发化学反应，最终将水通道蛋白2水通道插入集合管细胞膜。这些通道允许水重新吸收到血液中，这使得尿液更加浓缩。当液体摄入量充足时，会产生较少的ADH。没有来自ADH的信号，水通道蛋白2水通道从集合管细胞的膜上去除。在这些时候，更少的水被重新吸收到血流中，尿液更稀薄。“>”>	0

When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone attaches (binds) to the vasopressin V2 receptor and directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water back into the bloodstream.

ANK2	The ANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin-B. Ankyrin-B is part of a family of ankyrin proteins, which interact with many other types of proteins in cells throughout the body. Ankyrins help organize the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton) and link certain proteins that span the cell membrane to this framework. Additionally, ankyrins play key roles in important functions including cell movement (migration) and cell growth and division (proliferation).The ankyrin-B protein is active in many cell types, particularly in the brain and in heart (cardiac) muscle. This protein mainly interacts with ion channels and ion transporters, which are complexes of proteins that move charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. In the heart, the flow of ions (such as sodium, potassium, and calcium) through ion channels and ion transporters generates the electrical signals that control the heartbeat and maintain a normal heart rhythm. Ankyrin-B ensures these channels and transporters are in their proper locations in the cell membrane so they can regulate the flow of ions into and out of cardiac muscle cells. In addition, ankyrin-B helps ensure that signaling molecules that regulate the activity of ion channels and ion transporters are in the proper location.<> <>	ANK2基因提供了制造称为锚蛋白-B的蛋白质的说明。锚蛋白-B是锚蛋白家族的一部分，锚蛋白与整个身体细胞中的许多其他类型的蛋白质相互作用。 Ankyrins帮助组织细胞的结构框架（细胞骨架）并将跨越细胞膜的某些蛋白质连接到该框架。此外，ankyrins在包括细胞运动（迁移）和细胞生长和分裂（增殖）等重要功能中发挥关键作用。锚蛋白-B蛋白在许多细胞类型中都有活性，特别是在大脑和心脏（心脏）肌肉中。这种蛋白质主要与离子通道和离子转运蛋白相互作用，离子转运蛋白是将电荷原子（离子）移动穿过细胞膜的蛋白质复合物。在心脏中，通过离子通道和离子转运蛋白的离子（如钠，钾和钙）的流动产生控制心跳并保持正常心律的电信号。 Ankyrin-B确保这些通道和转运蛋白位于细胞膜的适当位置，因此它们可以调节进出心肌细胞的离子流。此外，锚蛋白-B有助于确保调控离子通道和离子转运蛋白活性的信号分子处于适当的位置。<> <>	0
ANGPTL3	From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a member of a family of secreted proteins that function in angiogenesis. The encoded protein, which is expressed predominantly in the liver, is further processed into an N-terminal coiled-coil domain-containing chain and a C-terminal fibrinogen chain. The N-terminal chain is important for lipid metabolism, while the C-terminal chain may be involved in angiogenesis. Mutations in this gene cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia type 2. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2015]From UniProt:Acts in part as a hepatokine that is involved in regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism (PubMed:11788823, PubMed:12909640, PubMed:23661675, PubMed:25495645). Proposed to play a role in the trafficking of energy substrates to either storage or oxidative tissues in response to food intake (By similarity). Has a stimulatory effect on plasma triglycerides (TG), which is achieved by suppressing plasma TG clearance via inhibition of LPL activity. The inhibition of LPL activity appears to be an indirect mechanism involving recruitment of proprotein convertases PCSK6 and FURIN to LPL leading to cleavage and dissociation of LPL from the cell surface; the function does not require ANGPTL3 proteolytic cleavage but seems to be mediated by the N-terminal domain, and is not inhibited by GPIHBP1 (PubMed:12097324, PubMed:19318355, PubMed:20581395). Can inhibit endothelial lipase, causing increased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and phospholipids (PubMed:17110602, PubMed:19028676). Can bind to adipocytes to activate lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol (PubMed:12565906). Suppresses LPL specifically in oxidative tissues which is required to route very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG to white adipose tissue (WAT) for storage in response to food; the function may involve cooperation with circulating, liver-derived ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL4 expression in WAT (By similarity). Contributes to lower plasma levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by a mechanism that is independent of the canonical pathway implicating APOE and LDLR. May stimulate hypothalamic LPL activity.Involved in angiogenesis. Binds to endothelial cells via integrin alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGAV:ITGB3), activates FAK, MAPK and Akt signaling pathways and induces cell adhesion and cell migration (PubMed:11877390). Secreted from podocytes, may modulate properties of glomerular endothelial cells involving integrin alpha-V/beta-3 and Akt signaling (PubMed:18535744). May increase the motility of podocytes. May induce actin filament rearrangements in podocytes implicating integrin alpha-V/beta-3 and Rac1 activation. Binds to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and is involved in the regulation of HSC activity probably implicating down-regulation of IKZF1/IKAROS.ANGPTL3(17-221): In vitro inhibits LPL activity; not effective on GPIHBP1-stabilized LPL.<> <>	来自NCBI基因：该基因编码在血管生成中起作用的分泌蛋白家族的成员。主要在肝脏中表达的编码蛋白被进一步加工成含N末端卷曲螺旋结构域链和C末端纤维蛋白原链。 N端链对于脂质代谢是重要的，而C端链可能参与血管生成。 [来自RefSeq，2015年8月提供]来自UniProt：部分作为参与调节脂质和糖代谢的肝细胞因子（PubMed：11788823，PubMed：12909640，PubMed：23661675，考研：25495645）。建议在向食物摄入量反应时向储存或氧化组织贩卖能量基质方面发挥作用（相似性）。对血浆甘油三酯（TG）具有刺激作用，通过抑制LPL活性来抑制血浆TG清除。 LPL活性的抑制似乎是间接机制，其涉及将前体蛋白转化酶PCSK6和FURIN募集至LPL，从而导致LPL从细胞表面裂解和解离;该功能不需要ANGPTL3蛋白水解切割但似乎由N端结构域介导，并且不受GPIHBP1（PubMed：12097324，PubMed：19318355，PubMed：20581395）的抑制。可抑制内皮脂肪酶，引起血浆高密度脂蛋白（HDL）胆固醇和磷脂水平升高（PubMed：17110602，PubMed：19028676）。可以结合脂肪细胞来激活脂肪分解，释放游离脂肪酸和甘油（PubMed：12565906）。特别是在需要将极低密度脂蛋白（VLDL）-TG传递至白色脂肪组织（WAT）以响应食物储存的氧化组织中抑制LPL;该功能可能涉及与WAT中循环的，肝源ANGPTL8和ANGPTL4表达的合作（通过相似性）。通过独立于涉及APOE和LDLR的规范途径的机制，有助于降低血浆低密度脂蛋白（LDL） - 胆固醇水平。可能刺激下丘脑LPL活性。参与血管生成。通过整合素α-V /β-3（ITGAV：ITGB3）与内皮细胞结合，激活FAK，MAPK和Akt信号通路并诱导细胞粘附和细胞迁移（PubMed：11877390）。从足细胞分泌，可调节涉及整合素α-V /β-3和Akt信号传导的肾小球内皮细胞的特性（PubMed：18535744）。可能会增加足细胞的运动性。可能会诱导足细胞肌动蛋白丝重排，牵连整合素α-V /β-3和Rac1激活。与造血干细胞（HSC）结合，参与调节HSC活性，可能牵涉IKZF1 / IKAROS的下调.ANGPTL3（17-221）：体外抑制LPL活性;对GPIHBP1稳定的LPL无效。“>”	0

The C-terminal domain may be proteolytically-cleaved from the full-length secreted protein. Decreased expression of this gene has been associated with type 2 diabetes.

PRKAG2	The PRKAG2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the gamma-2 subunit) of a larger enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This enzyme helps sense and respond to energy demands within cells.  It is active in many different tissues, including heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).  AMP-activated protein kinase is likely involved in the development of the heart before birth, although its role in this process is unknown.AMP-activated protein kinase regulates chemical pathways involving the cell's main energy source, a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  The breakdown of ATP releases energy to drive many types of chemical reactions.  AMP-activated protein kinase is activated during times of cellular stress (such as low oxygen levels or muscle exercise), when ATP is broken down rapidly to produce energy.  If ATP levels become too low, the enzyme restores the balance of energy by limiting chemical reactions that require ATP and stimulating pathways that generate ATP.Studies suggest that AMP-activated protein kinase may play a role in controlling the activity of other genes, although many of these genes have not been identified.  The enzyme may also regulate the activity of certain ion channels in the heart.  These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) into and out of heart  muscle cells, play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm.<> <>	PRKAG2基因提供了制造称为AMP-活化蛋白激酶（AMPK）的较大酶的一部分（γ-2亚基）的模板。这种酶有助于感知和响应细胞内的能量需求。它在许多不同的组织中都很活跃，包括心肌和骨骼肌。 AMP激活的蛋白激酶可能参与了出生前心脏的发育，尽管它在这个过程中的作用尚不清楚。AMP激活的蛋白激酶调节涉及细胞主要能量来源的化学途径，一种叫做三磷酸腺苷（ATP）的分子。 ATP的分解释放出能量以驱动许多类型的化学反应。当ATP被快速分解以产生能量时，AMP激活的蛋白激酶在细胞应激时（例如低氧水平或肌肉锻炼）被激活。如果ATP水平过低，酶通过限制需要ATP的化学反应和刺激产生ATP的途径来恢复能量平衡。研究表明AMP激活的蛋白激酶可能在控制其他基因的活性方面发挥作用，尽管许多这些基因尚未确定。该酶还可以调节心脏中某些离子通道的活性。这些将离子输入和输出心肌细胞的通道在维持心脏正常节律方面起着关键作用。	1

PSEN2	The PSEN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin 2. Presenilin 2 helps process proteins that transmit chemical signals from the cell membrane into the nucleus.

Research suggests that presenilin 2 works together with other enzymes to cut amyloid precursor protein into smaller segments (peptides). One of these peptides is called soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP), and another is called amyloid beta peptide.

HSD11B2	From NCBI Gene:There are at least two isozymes of the corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase, a microsomal enzyme complex responsible for the interconversion of cortisol and cortisone. The type I isozyme has both 11-beta-dehydrogenase (cortisol to cortisone) and 11-oxoreductase (cortisone to cortisol) activities. The type II isozyme, encoded by this gene, has only 11-beta-dehydrogenase activity. In aldosterone-selective epithelial tissues such as the kidney, the type II isozyme catalyzes the glucocorticoid cortisol to the inactive metabolite cortisone, thus preventing illicit activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor. In tissues that do not express the mineralocorticoid receptor, such as the placenta and testis, it protects cells from the growth-inhibiting and/or pro-apoptotic effects of cortisol, particularly during embryonic development. Mutations in this gene cause the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess and hypertension.

LAMP2	The LAMP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called lysosomal associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), which, as its name suggests, is found in the membrane of cellular structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. The role the LAMP-2 protein plays in the lysosome is unclear. Some researchers think the LAMP-2 protein may help transport cellular materials or digestive enzymes into the lysosome. The transport of cellular materials into lysosomes requires the formation of cellular structures called autophagic vacuoles (or autophagosomes). Cellular material that will be degraded in a lysosome is first enclosed in an autophagic vacuole inside the cell. The autophagic vacuole attaches (fuses) to a lysosome to transfer the cellular material into the lysosome where it can be broken down. The LAMP-2 protein may be involved in the fusion between autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes.Slightly different versions (isoforms) of the LAMP-2 protein are produced: LAMP-2A, LAMP-2B, and LAMP-2C. These isoforms are found in different tissues throughout the body. LAMP-2B is the main isoform found in the heart and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).
